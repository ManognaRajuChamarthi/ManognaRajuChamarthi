### Hi there 👋
🌱 I’m currently learning Game Devlopement using Unity
🔭 C language, C# for unity are the languages I am comfortable with
🐍 I'm learning Python actively, as it is the most used language to build Machine Learning and AI Models
🖥️ We know that games can use a good AI so I would like to know more about its application in designing Games.

If you cant tell already, Let me spill it "I LOVE VIDEO GAMES"

Have a good day.
